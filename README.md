# Network-Intrusion-Detection-System-NIDS-using-AI-and-ML
A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using AI/ML monitors network traffic in real-time to detect anomalies, intrusions, and cyberattacks. Unlike rule-based systems, it learns from data, adapts to new threats, and improves accuracy. Using advanced algorithms, it reduces false positives and enhances proactive, scalable,
